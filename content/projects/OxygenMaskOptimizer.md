During my journey at the HEIG-VD's [Institute of Industrial Automation](https://heig-vd.ch/recherche/instituts/iai/), I took ownership of this 300K&nbsp;CHF [InnoSuisse](https://www.innosuisse.admin.ch/) Project.

I developed a sophisticated 3D algorithm in C++ that simulates the interaction between oxygen masks and 3D scans of user face, to found the perfect fit, reducing discomfort and leaks.
