During my journey at the HEIG-VD's [Institute of Industrial Automation](https://heig-vd.ch/recherche/instituts/iai/), I developped an algorithm called Sysyre to detect the presence of impurty in a medical cartrige. By filming the cartridge rotating on itself, we were able to distinguish between scratches on the glass and impurities in the contents.
