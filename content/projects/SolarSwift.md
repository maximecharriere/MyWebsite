Created the Business Concept of **SolarSwift**, a digital platform designed to bridge the gap between property owners, investors, and service providers, orchestrating the establishment of new photovoltaic (PV) systems across Switzerland.

Central to SolarSwift's approach is the **Fractional Third-Party Ownership** (F-TPO) model, which permits multiple investors to collectively own portions of a PV system.
