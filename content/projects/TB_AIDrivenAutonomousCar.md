Inside of the HEIG-VD's [Institute of Industrial Automation](https://heig-vd.ch/recherche/instituts/iai/), I developed the electronics and embedded software in Python / C++ of an autonomous car. It is capable of road following, obstacle avoidance and sign detection, using Computer Vision (OpenCV) and Deep Learning (TensorFlow).
