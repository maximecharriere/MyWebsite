For my Bachelor Thesis, I developed the electronics and embedded software in Python / C++ of an autonomous car, under the supervision of [Prof. Bressy Pierre](https://people.hes-so.ch/en/profile/241692459-pierre-bressy).

It is capable of road following, obstacle avoidance and sign detection, using Computer Vision (OpenCV) and Deep Learning (TensorFlow).
