During my journey at the HEIG-VD's [Institute of Industrial Automation](https://heig-vd.ch/recherche/instituts/iai/), I developped an application assisting the medical practitioner with live
image analysis of eyes reacting to different light frequencies and intensities.

Developped in C#/WPF, it controls a medical device composed of LEDs to stimulate the patient's eyes, and cameras to capture the pupils' reaction. Image analysis is performed in OpenCV.
