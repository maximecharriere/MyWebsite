For my first freelance experience on a 10K CHF contract, I developed a CO₂ Emissions Calculator for [Swiss Climate](https://www.swissclimate.ch/). This tool helps real estate companies measure and report their buildings' carbon footprint in accordance with the [PACTA 2022](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/climate/info-specialists/climate-and-financial-markets/pacta.html) sustainability standard.
