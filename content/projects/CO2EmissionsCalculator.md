For my first freelance experience on a 10K CHF contract, I worked with [Swiss Climate](https://www.swissclimate.ch/) to developed a CO₂ Emissions Calculator for buildings, helping sustainability reporting of companies in the real estate sector, following the [PACTA 2022](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/climate/info-specialists/climate-and-financial-markets/pacta.html) standard.
